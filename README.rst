Add **roles** or **groups** to anonymous or logged-in visitors based on **HTTP headers**

.. contents:: **Table of contents**

Introduction
============

The AutoRoleFromHostHeader PAS plugin allows to assign roles to users looking
at HTTP headers.

There is an extraction and authentication plugin included, to enable
additional roles for anonymous users. They are required since PAS does
not support roles (or properties or groups) for anonymous users.
You can disable these interfaces if only logged-in users should get
additional roles.

AutoRoleFromHostHeader furthermore provides a groups plugin interface,
allowing you to assign groups instead of roles.

Configuration
=============

The plugin is configured by editing the ``Header name; regexp; roles/groups``
property on the plugin's properties screen (through ZMI).
Each line represents a mapping from an header value (using a regexp match) to
one or more roles. The format is as follows::

    http_header_name; regular expression; role[, role ...] ; TALES

The TALES field allows arbitrary expressions to be added to role mappings, for example to check other HTTP headers.

Assign groups, not roles
------------------------

This plugin can be used to assign groups instead of roles if used as a
*group plugin* instead of a role plugin::

    http_header_name; regular expression; group[, group ...] ; TALES

Groups plugin is not activated by default.

Caveat
======

If you have AutoRoleFromHostHeader configured for anonymous users and come
from a network matching one of its rules, you will **not** be able to log in
with an account from a higher-up user folder. This is because AutoRole
authenticates the Anonymous User which stops the lookup process.

Dependencies
============

Tested with all Plone versions from 3.3. to 4.3.
